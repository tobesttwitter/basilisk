## What is Basilisk?

**Basilisk** is an open-source offensive security framework purpose-built for **AI red teaming** and **LLM penetration testing**. It maps its attack surface to the **OWASP LLM Top 10** threat model and combines that coverage with a genetic algorithm engine called **Smart Prompt Evolution (SPE-NL)** that evolves adversarial prompt payloads across generations.

Whether you are testing **OpenAI GPT-4o**, **Anthropic Claude**, **Google Gemini**, **NVIDIA API Catalog**, **xAI Grok**, **Meta Llama**, or a custom LLM endpoint, Basilisk provides 33 attack modules, 5 recon modules, differential multi-model scanning, guardrail posture grading, and signed audit logging out of the box.

v2.0.2 adds deterministic CLI/desktop parity testing, fixes Linux Electron backend startup, and keeps the v2 runtime, evidence, and secret-handling hardening.

### Why Basilisk?

- **Automated AI Red Teaming**: Start from probes and attack modules, then let Basilisk iterate through payload variants automatically.
- **Genetic Prompt Evolution**: The SPE-NL engine mutates, crosses over, and scores prompts across generations. When a static payload gets refused, evolution searches for nearby variants that preserve intent while changing delivery.
- **OWASP-Aligned Attack Coverage**: 33 modules covering prompt injection, system prompt extraction, data exfiltration, tool abuse, guardrail bypass, denial of service, multi-turn manipulation, RAG attacks, and multimodal injection.
- **Evidence-Backed Findings**: Every finding carries structured evidence signals, replay steps, and calibrated verdicts. Production-tier findings get downgraded if the proof is weak. No more "the model said something bad" as your entire evidence chain.
- **Broad Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, NVIDIA API Catalog, xAI (Grok), Groq, Azure, AWS Bedrock, GitHub Models, Ollama, vLLM, and custom HTTP/WebSocket endpoints.
- **CI/CD Ready**: Native GitHub Action with SARIF output and baseline regression detection for automated AI security testing in your pipeline.
- **Desktop App**: Electron GUI for visual red teaming with live scan dashboards, campaign controls, and report export.

Built by **[Regaan](https://regaan.rothackers.com)**, Lead Researcher at **[ROT Independent Security Research Lab](https://rothackers.com)**, and creator of **[WSHawk](https://wshawk.rothackers.com)**.

## Research Context

Basilisk is described in the following research paper:

Regaan R. *Basilisk: An Evolutionary AI Red-Teaming Framework for Systematic Security Evaluation of Large Language Models*. SSRN Electronic Journal, 2026.

The paper formalizes:
- Evolutionary prompt search (SPE-NL)
- Multi-objective fitness scoring
- Behavioral space exploration
- Differential model evaluation

This repository contains the full implementation used for experimental evaluation.

---

## Key Contributions

- Introduces evolutionary prompt search (SPE-NL) for LLM security testing
- Demonstrates multi-objective fitness scoring for adversarial prompts
- Enables behavioral space exploration beyond static jailbreaks
- Provides reproducible evaluation framework across multiple LLM providers

## Quick Start

basilisk scan -t https://api.target.com/chat -p github -m gpt-4o

# Pipeline gate with SARIF output
basilisk scan -t https://api.target.com/chat -o sarif --fail-on high
```

## Zero-Setup Live Demo

Want to see Basilisk in action without configuring API keys? We maintain an intentionally vulnerable LLM target for testing:

**Target URL:** `https://basilisk-vulnbot.onrender.com/v1/chat/completions`

```bash
# No API keys required for this target
basilisk scan -t https://basilisk-vulnbot.onrender.com/v1/chat/completions -p custom --model vulnbot-1.0 --mode quick
```

Or use the Desktop App: open **New Scan**, set the endpoint URL above, pick **Custom HTTP** as the provider, and hit start.

### Docker

```bash
docker pull rothackers/basilisk

docker run --rm -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... rothackers/basilisk \
  scan -t https://api.target.com/chat --mode quick
```

---

## Reproduce Results

Run a minimal experiment from the paper:

```bash
basilisk scan -t https://basilisk-vulnbot.onrender.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -p custom \
  --mode standard \
  --generations 5 \
  --output results/
```

This reproduces:

- Evolutionary prompt search
- Guardrail bypass discovery
- Behavioral divergence patterns

---

## Experimental Setup

- Models tested: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0
- Attack modules: 33 (OWASP LLM Top 10 aligned)
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Refusal bypass rate
  - Leakage success rate
  - Behavioral diversity score
  - Evolution convergence rate

---

## Features

### Smart Prompt Evolution (SPE-NL)

The core differentiator. Genetic algorithms adapted for natural language attack payloads:

- **10 mutation operators** -- synonym swap, encoding wrap, role injection, language shift, structure overhaul, fragment split, homoglyph substitution, context padding, token smuggling, LLM-driven mutation
- **5 crossover strategies** -- single-point, uniform, prefix-suffix, semantic blend, best-of-both
- **Multi-objective fitness** -- refusal avoidance, information leakage, compliance scoring, target pattern matching, cost efficiency, intent preservation, reproducibility, and novelty. NSGA-II Pareto ranking when multiple objectives are active.
- **Curiosity-driven exploration** -- behavioral space partitioning with TF-IDF clustering and adaptive bin splitting. Rewards mutations that land in under-visited response regions instead of repeating the same refusal pattern.
- **Intent preservation** -- tracks semantic drift from original seed payloads across generations. Mutations that stray too far from the attack goal get penalized.
- **Operator learning** -- multi-armed bandit selects which mutation operators work best against the current target
- **Stagnation detection** with adaptive mutation rate, early breakthrough exit, and population deduplication
- **Response cache** -- SHA-256 keyed LRU cache avoids burning API tokens on duplicate payloads

Payloads that fail get mutated, crossed, and re-evaluated. The search loop keeps useful variants, removes duplicates, and shifts pressure when the target response distribution stagnates.

### 33 Attack Modules

33 modules across 9 attack categories with 3 trust tiers, mapped to the OWASP LLM Top 10 threat model. See [Attack Modules](#attack-modules) below.

### Trust Tiers and Evidence Policy

Not every module is treated the same. Basilisk assigns each module a trust tier:

- **production** (11 modules) -- strictest evidence requirements, included by default
- **beta** (18 modules) -- included by default but held to a lower proof standard
- **research** (4 modules) -- excluded unless you explicitly opt in

High and critical findings from production modules get checked against module-specific proof requirements. If the evidence is weak, the finding is downgraded and the downgrade reason is preserved in session data and reports. This is how Basilisk separates "interesting behavior" from "defensible evidence."

### 5 Reconnaissance Modules

- **Model Fingerprinting** -- identifies GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral via response patterns and timing
- **Guardrail Profiling** -- systematic probing across 8 content categories
- **Tool/Function Discovery** -- enumerates available tools and API schemas
- **Context Window Measurement** -- determines token limits
- **RAG Pipeline Detection** -- identifies retrieval-augmented generation setups

### Differential Testing

Run identical probes against multiple providers or model targets and compare where one path refuses while another complies. Basilisk records per-model outcomes and per-probe breakdowns for side-by-side review.

```bash
basilisk diff -t openai:gpt-4o -t anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 -t google:gemini/gemini-2.0-flash
```

### Guardrail Posture Assessment

Recon-only guardrail grading:
- A+ through F posture grades
- 8 categories with 3-tier probing (benign/moderate/adversarial)
- Strength classification: None, Weak, Moderate, Strong, Aggressive
- Actionable recommendations for weak spots and over-filtering

### Eval Runner

When you already know the exact prompts and assertions you need, skip the exploratory scan and run a deterministic eval suite:

- Assertion types: `must_refuse`, `must_not_refuse`, `must_contain`, `must_not_contain`, `max_compliance`, `max_tokens`, `regex_match`, `regex_no_match`, `similarity`, `llm_grade`
- Output in console, JSON, JUnit XML, or Markdown
- Diff against previous results for regression detection
- Tag-based filtering and parallel execution

### Probe Corpus

263 probes in YAML across 9 categories. Single prompts, ordered multi-turn sequences, and fabricated role/content histories use the same versioned loader. Every probe carries an OWASP mapping; most include expected signals, and many include tags. The loader also supports richer optional metadata such as objectives, preconditions, failure modes, target archetypes, tool requirements, and follow-up probe IDs as the corpus evolves. The corpus seeds evolution runs and feeds the effectiveness tracker.

### Audit Logging

On by default. Ed25519-signed JSONL with SHA-256 chain integrity:
- Scan configuration, campaign policy, findings, errors, evolution, recon, and report events are logged
- Prompt and response event methods are available for integrations that explicitly enable those hooks
- API keys automatically redacted before writing
- Desktop master keys protected with Electron `safeStorage` when a secure operating-system backend is available
- CLI scans executed in restricted child workers with mode-specific OS resource ceilings
- Audit key resolution: key file, encrypted secret store, or legacy environment variable
- Export the signing trust anchor once with `basilisk audit-trust-export audit-public.key`, store it independently, then verify files with `basilisk audit-verify PATH --public-key-file audit-public.key`
- `basilisk audit-verify PATH --allow-embedded-key` checks integrity only and does not establish external authenticity

### 5 Report Formats

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **HTML** | Dark-themed report with expandable findings, conversation replay, severity charts |
| **SARIF 2.1.0** | CI/CD integration -- GitHub Code Scanning, DefectDojo, Azure DevOps |
| **JSON** | Machine-readable with full metadata |
| **Markdown** | Documentation-ready, commit-friendly |
| **PDF** | Offline sharing using weasyprint, reportlab, or the built-in basic PDF renderer |

### Campaign and Policy Controls

Scans carry operator context and execution policy:
- Campaign metadata: operator name, ticket ID, target owner, objective, hypothesis
- Execution modes: `recon`, `validate`, `exploit_chain`, `research`
- Evidence thresholds, retention windows, module allow/deny lists
- Approval gates and dry-run planning
- All of this lands in session state and reports -- not decorative fields

### Universal Provider Support

Via `litellm` + custom adapters:
- **Cloud** -- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, NVIDIA API Catalog, xAI (Grok), Groq, Azure, AWS Bedrock
- **GitHub Models** -- free access to GPT-4o, o1, and more via `github.com/marketplace/models`
- **Local** -- Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp
- **Custom** -- any HTTP REST API or WebSocket endpoint
- **WSHawk** -- pairs with WSHawk for WebSocket-based AI testing

### Electron Desktop App

Full desktop GUI with:
- Live scan visualization via the desktop event bridge
- Campaign control plane with operator, ticket, and policy fields
- Differential scan tab with multi-model comparison
- Guardrail posture tab with live grading
- Audit trail viewer with integrity verification
- Module browser with OWASP mapping and trust tier display
- Probe explorer with filtering and stats
- Eval runner with assertion-driven testing
- Session management with replay and evidence review
- Report export dialog for HTML, JSON, SARIF, and PDF
- Cross-platform: Windows (.exe), macOS (.dmg), Linux (.AppImage/.deb/.rpm/.pacman)

### Native C/Go Extensions

Performance-critical paths compiled to shared libraries with full Python fallbacks:
- **C** -- BPE token estimation, Shannon entropy, Levenshtein distance, confusable detection, payload encoding (base64, hex, ROT13, URL, Unicode escape)
- **Go** -- concurrent mutation operators (including 4 multi-turn aware), crossover modes, batch mutation, population diversity scoring, Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching, refusal/compliance/sensitive data detection
- Native libraries load only after an **Ed25519-signed manifest** and SHA-256 hashes verify. Unsigned or mismatched libraries are rejected and Basilisk uses its Python fallback.

---

## What's New in v2.0.2

### Security Hardening

v2.0.2 includes the v2 runtime hardening plus release, benchmark, and desktop reliability fixes:

- **Ed25519 Signed Native Libraries** -- Native libraries are loaded only after verifying their SHA-256 hashes against an Ed25519-signed manifest.
- **Ed25519 Audit Log Signatures** -- Every audit log entry is digitally signed. Legacy HMAC-SHA256 is deprecated. Audit key resolution prefers encrypted local storage over environment variables.
- **CLI Secret Rejection** -- inline `--api-key`, `--attacker-api-key`, and `--auth` values are rejected. Credentials must come from environment variables, encrypted desktop settings, or `@file` references, keeping them out of shell history and process listings.
- **SQLite Worker Architecture** -- Replaced ad-hoc locking with a dedicated worker thread per database path. WAL mode, async queue, and single-writer semantics reduce event-loop contention.
- **Native Bridge Input Guardrails** -- FFI calls enforce input size limits. Oversized Levenshtein or similarity calls are rejected before reaching native code.
- **Path Traversal Protection** -- Config file loading uses `Path.resolve()` and ancestry checks against a safe root allowlist. String-prefix matching is gone.
- **LLM Mutation Isolation** -- The attacker-model mutation prompt wraps payloads in JSON and explicitly treats embedded payload content as untrusted data.
- **Go Fuzzer Crypto Seeding** -- PRNG seeded from `crypto/rand` instead of `time.Now()`. Mutation sequences are no longer predictable.
- **Retention Timestamp Hardening** -- Artifact pruning prefers embedded UTC timestamps over filesystem mtime, which is trivially spoofable.
- **Desktop Context Isolation** -- `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`, webview and navigation blocked, permission requests denied, external URLs allowlisted, backend requests gated through the desktop request bridge.

### Evidence-Backed Findings

Findings now carry structured `EvidenceBundle` objects with typed signals, replay steps, calibrated verdicts, and per-module proof requirements. The evidence policy engine can downgrade severity when proof is insufficient.

### Curiosity-Driven Exploration

The evolution engine now partitions the response space into behavioral clusters and rewards mutations that land in sparse, under-visited regions. Adaptive bin splitting helps prevent curiosity collapse. The novelty signal combines visit frequency, semantic novelty, and behavioral novelty.

### Multi-Objective Fitness

NSGA-II Pareto ranking with crowding distance. The fitness function evaluates exploit evidence, target-signal match, refusal avoidance, novelty, intent preservation, reproducibility, and cost efficiency as separate objectives when multi-objective mode is active.

### Probe Effectiveness Tracking

SQLite-backed tracker at `~/.basilisk/probe_effectiveness.db`. Records which probes worked against which models, categories, and archetypes. Computes bypass rates, block rates, and historical trends. Feeds back into probe prioritization.

### Eval Runner

Deterministic assertion-driven test harness. YAML config with typed assertions (`must_refuse`, `must_contain`, `regex_match`, `similarity`, `llm_grade`, etc.). Console, JSON, JUnit, and Markdown output. Diff against previous results for regression detection. Parallel execution. Tag-based filtering.

### Previous Releases

## Scan Modes

| Mode | Description | Evolution | Speed |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| `quick` | Top payloads per module, no evolution | No | Fast |
| `standard` | Full payloads, 5 generations of evolution | Yes | Normal |
| `deep` | Full payloads, 10+ generations, multi-turn chains | Yes | Slow |
| `stealth` | Rate-limited, human-like timing delays | Yes | Careful |
| `chaos` | Everything enabled, maximum evolution pressure | Yes | Aggressive |

Scan mode and execution mode are separate controls. Scan mode shapes runtime behavior. Execution mode (`recon`, `validate`, `exploit_chain`, `research`) shapes the operational policy and evidence requirements. They are orthogonal.

## FAQ

### What is Basilisk used for?

Basilisk is used for automated AI red teaming and LLM security testing. It is designed to exercise prompt injection, jailbreak, data leakage, tool-abuse, RAG, and guardrail bypass paths in AI applications built on hosted or local large language models.

### How does it compare to manual jailbreak testing?

Manual testing stops at static payloads. Basilisk starts there and then evolves them. When a payload gets refused, the mutation engine generates variants by changing structure, encoding, framing, and composition while keeping the same objective. Over multiple generations, the search pressure moves toward payload families that better match the current target.

### Does Basilisk work with local models?

Yes. Basilisk supports Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, and any custom HTTP or WebSocket endpoint. You can test self-hosted Llama, Mistral, Qwen, or any open-weight model.

### Can I use Basilisk in CI/CD?

Yes. Basilisk ships a native GitHub Action (`regaan/basilisk@main`) and supports SARIF output for GitHub Code Scanning, DefectDojo, and Azure DevOps. Baseline regression detection is built in -- your pipeline fails when new findings appear that were not in the previous baseline.

### What does the trust tier system do?

It controls evidence expectations. A production-tier finding must carry structured evidence signals and module-specific proof markers. If those are missing, the finding gets downgraded automatically. Beta and research tiers have progressively looser requirements. This is how Basilisk separates "the model said something weird" from "here is a reproducible vulnerability with replay steps."

### Is Basilisk free?

Fully open-source under AGPL-3.0. No restrictions on authorized security testing use.
